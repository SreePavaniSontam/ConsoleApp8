        Question 6
        You are given a string s of lowercase English letters and an array widths denoting how many pixels wide each lowercase English letter is. Specifically, widths[0] is the width of 'a', widths[1] is the width of 'b', and so on.
        You are trying to write s across several lines, where each line is no longer than 100 pixels. Starting at the beginning of s, write as many letters on the first line such that the total width does not exceed 100 pixels. Then, from where you stopped in s, continue writing as many letters as you can on the second line. Continue this process until you have written all of s.
        Return an array result of length 2 where:
             •	result[0] is the total number of lines.
             •	result[1] is the width of the last line in pixels.

        Output: [3,60]
        Explanation: You can write s as follows:
                     abcdefghij  	 // 100 pixels wide
                     klmnopqrst  	 // 100 pixels wide
                     uvwxyz      	 // 60 pixels wide
                     There are a total of 3 lines, and the last line is 60 pixels wide.

         Question 8
        International Morse Code defines a standard encoding where each letter is mapped to a series of dots and dashes, as follows:
        •	'a' maps to ".-",
        •	'b' maps to "-...",
        •	'c' maps to "-.-.", and so on.
        For convenience, the full table for the 26 letters of the English alphabet is given below:
        [".-","-...","-.-.","-..",".","..-.","--.","....","..",".---","-.-",".-..","--","-.","---",".--.","--.-",".-.","...","-","..-","...-",".--","-..-","-.--","--.."]
